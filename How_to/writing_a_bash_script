This is a short and simple guide outlining how to make a script in bash on unix/linux


    1. Using a terminal you will type: 
    
        nano (whaterver you want to name it).sh
    
        It should look something like the following:

            nano myScript.sh
            nano yourScript.sh
            nano jesusChrist.sh
            nano unitedStates.sh

        If you are following along I will name it jesusChrist.sh
    
    2. This opens up nano within your terminal and creates the file. 
    From here you can begin writing your script. 

    3. If you intend on using bash and want to make extra sure you are 
    going to have your system use the bash shell to interpret your script
    you should start the file with "shebang".

        a shebang looks like this:
            #!/bin/bash

    4. Write your commands. If you are simply following along with this 
    short and simple guide lets just use one of the following eamples
     for now:
       
       Example 1. 
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Alpha and the omega."
       
       Example 2.
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "Hallowed be thy name."
       
       Example 3.
       #!/bin/bash
       echo "The beginning and the end."

    5. Save the file.
        5.1 
            Save the file by pressing Ctrl+O 
            (As in the Control Key that 
             is in the bottom left hand
             of the keyboard and 
             abbreviated as "Ctrl" 
             and the letter O)
        
            After pressing Ctrl+O it will likely say
            "Write to File: (THE NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT).sh"
            near the bottom left hand corner of the screen.
            In my case since I named it "jesusChrist.sh"
            this is what it will look like:
                "Write to File: jesusChrist.sh"
    
        5.2
            Just press enter. (This confirms you want to save your work.)
             It should say "[ Wrote 3 lines ]"
        5.3 Now press Ctrl+X (This exits you out of nano and back to the terminal.)

    6. Making the script executable
    
        To make the script executabable we
        will be using the following "chmod +x" command.
        This adds execute (+x) permission to the file 
        which allows us to run the file as a regular
        degular command. By itself chmod doesnt do
        anything on its own. It stands for
        "change mode" though.

        6.1 
            Run chmod +x jesusChrist.sh
            Thats it nothing else. We turned
            our script file into an executable
            program.

    7. Run the script

        7.1 
            Run the script by typing "./" in the terminal
            followed by the name of the program like so:

                ./jesusChrist.sh
        
            then press enter.
        
        7.2
            Because in step 4, I wrote:
                
                #!/bin/bash
                echo "Hallowed be thy name."
            
            my return in the console was:

             Hallowed be thy name.


    9. Congratulations! You wrote your a bash script!
    Well done. I hope you continue to learn how to use linux
    and bash scripting more and more. It is well worth it.
