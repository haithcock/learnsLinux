To enable math functions within bash you need to use the
evaluate expressions command. This is abbreviated as "expr"

    For example:
        running this:
            "30 + 10"
        results in a return of the following:
        "30: command not found"
    
    However
        running this:
            "expr 30+10" 
        results in a return of the following:
             "40"
