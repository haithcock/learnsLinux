on 6/23/2025 I have officialler learned the following commands:

    pwd: pwd tells you your current working directory

    chmod: chmod means "change mode" but doesnt work by istelf

    chmod +x: makes a file executable like in today's lesson
              where I wrote a guide on how to write a script.

    echo: echo is used to print or display text or strings that 
          are passed to it. Like in python you would use:
             print("Hello, world!").
          Well in Bash you would type:
            echo "Hello, world!"

    date: returns the system time and date.

    $USER: a variable where the current username is stored.

     env: returns declared variables you have access
     to within your session.
